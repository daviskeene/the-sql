# the-sql
A CS411 @ UIUC Final Project - Creating a new course platform using a modern web application stack.

## Project Description
Our project idea spawned from the collective understanding that CS 411 could use better tools for learning SQL. PrairieLearn (the current homework solution) has a playground database that isn't very great and doesn't allow you to change schemas, the actual problems themselves are often difficult to understand, the schema visualization is bland, and using the Illinois Wiki page is difficult. If there was one standardized web application for CS 411, with SQL documentation, a playground, homework problems, zoom lecture links, and lecture videos all in one, it would unify everything and the class would feel more complete. So, we're challenging ourselves to do just that: create an all-in-one alternative to make it easy to learn about database systems.

## Getting Started

Run the following code from the root directory:

```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
